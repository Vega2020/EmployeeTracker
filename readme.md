## Project Description: 
The project is a command line interface application designed to create and manage an SQL database of employees and their roles. The application uses multiple tables which allow users to add, view, and update the status of employees. 
        
## Installation: 
The application creates a local MySQL server using express, and is meant to be run using node in Git Bash. MySQL workbench and node.JS are required for use. After downloading the files locally, create the SQL database using employeeTracker.sql. Then run index.js in the command line using node, and the application will start.
        
## Usage: 
After starting the program, use the arrow keys to select from the available option. Each option will lead the user through a series of prompts to add/view/update the relevant table in the SQL database and either return them to the main menu or terminate the program. The output will be saved permanently in the SQL server.
